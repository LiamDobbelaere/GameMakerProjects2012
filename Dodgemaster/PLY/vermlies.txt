VermillionLies-Shady There's a dark waiting for the sun to shine There's a cloud being lifted from my mind There's a black cat laying on my brown desktop There's someone that I'm singing to And I just can't stop I like you I like you I like you I like you I do I don't know why I feel this way about you We only met once but I feel you in me That one conversation still echoing So I am waiting for the sun to shine I'll have you over to drink some wine I'll get you drunk and take advantage of you Mmmm oh yeah that's what I'll do I like you I like you I like you I like you I do I don't know why I feel this way about you The Last Time I saw you you turned away My poor heart was breaking apart the next day There's a dark waiting for the sun to shine You're lifting so many of these clouds from my mind And now I see you almost every single day I don't know how I ever lived any other way You like me you like me you like me you like me I see I'm so glad that you feel this way about me We talk every day and we're still having fun What more could we ask for except a little more sun
